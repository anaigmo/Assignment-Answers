# This program has been created by Ana Iglesias Molina for the subject Bioinformatics Programming Challenges.
# Given a file with a list of genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, the interactions of their proteins are searched
# to create networks with two levels of depth. This networks are then written in the file 'Report.txt'.
