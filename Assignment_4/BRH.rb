#
# This program has been created by Ana Iglesias Molina for the subject Bioinformatics Programming Challenges.
#
# This program takes two multifasta files as databases, does blast against one another, saves the reciprocal
# best hits and prints it in a file called 'Reciprocal_best_hits.tsv'.
# The criteria to accept a best hit is an e-value of 1e-6, an overlap length of at least half the length
# of the query sequence and a percent of identity of 30%. I have chosen those values according to what
# I have read in the literature. The e-value is not tough, but above 1e-05 it seems it is not robust enough,
# and under 1e-6 is considered necesary for nucleotide blast. Regarding the overlapping length, it's the most
# common value I've seen. 70-75% of the length for overlap could be also used, but for a first approximation
# to look for orthologues I preferred not to be so tough, same happens with the value of identity, which is
# fixed at 30%.
